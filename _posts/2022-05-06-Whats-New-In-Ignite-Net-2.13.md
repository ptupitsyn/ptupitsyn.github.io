title: What's new in Apache Ignite.NET 2.13
---

[Apache Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/) 2.13 [has been released](https://blogs.apache.org/ignite/entry/apache-ignite-2-13-0).
Calcite-based SQL engine is the highlight of the release, but we are here to talk about .NET side of things, where thin client got some more improvements: retry policy, heartbeat messages, and more. 

(There was no blog post about Ignite [2.12](https://blogs.apache.org/ignite/entry/apache-ignite-2-12-0) because it was focused on bugfixes).
