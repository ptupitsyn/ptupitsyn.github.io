title: Why do I use Linux for .NET development?

The question of OS and IDE choice for .NET development comes up from time to time. In this post I'll summarize my thoughts on the topic.

# Performance

My main reason for choosing a certain tool (software or hardware) is productivity and performance.

As Joel Spolsky said in [his famous "12 steps to better code" article](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/), 
"always use the best tool money can buy".

I've started my professional career on .NET 1.1 in 2005, and back then Windows was the only option, with Visual Studio being the only IDE.
ReSharper was always a must-have, even though it was making the IDE slower.
