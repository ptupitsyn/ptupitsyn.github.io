title: Dynamic LINQ with Ignite.NET and System.Linq.Dynamic.Core
---

![Apache Ignite Persistent Store](../images/ignite-dynamic-linq.png) Some use cases, such as UI-based filtering, require dynamically built database queries. 
This can get challenging with LINQ-based frameworks such as EF Core and Ignite.NET.

# Use Case Example

# Simplification with System.Linq.Dynamic.Core

[Dynamic LINQ (System.Linq.Dynamic.Core)](https://github.com/zzzprojects/System.Linq.Dynamic.Core)

# TBD

Does it work? - yes
* Is it a good idea? - not sure
* If an abstraction gets in the way, drop down one level and just build the SQL yourself
