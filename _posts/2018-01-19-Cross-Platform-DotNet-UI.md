title: Cross-Platform Desktop .NET UI with Avalonia
---

Cross-platform .NET is all the rage now. You can do console apps in C# and F#, 
web with ASP.NET Core, mobile with Xamarin. But can you do desktop UI apps?

# Enter Avalonia

.NET Core by itself does not provide any UI framework, and Microsoft does not seem to bother with this.
They are mostly trying to appeal to web developers, and this is understandable: web apps are much more popular.

With Mono you could at least use Windows Forms, but Mono is old stuff.
