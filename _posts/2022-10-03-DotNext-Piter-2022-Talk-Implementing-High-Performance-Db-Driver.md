> Databases are the backbone of most applications. How do we talk to our database? How does the driver work, and how do you design and build a new one? This talk covers all the important steps: working with TCP sockets, message framing and serialization, failover, resource usage, and more. As a result, you will be able to build a driver for an existing database or design a protocol for a new one.
