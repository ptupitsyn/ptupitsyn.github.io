---

[Apache Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/) 2.14 [has been released](https://lists.apache.org/thread/s4l32s59no8lx689y921o47xdtg8g3n3).
.NET updates include Service Interceptors and AtomicLong.

# Service Interceptors (Middleware)

[Ignite Services API](https://ignite.apache.org/features/service-apis.html) provides a powerful mechanism for implementing distributed service-oriented applications.
Those applications typically need to deal with a number of [cross-cutting concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cutting_concern), such as logging, monitoring, authentication/authorization, validation, and so on.
