Thin Client improvements, better cross-platform support, Docker image, and more!


# Welcome Back

It has been a long time since the [last post in the series](https://ptupitsyn.github.io/Whats-New-In-Ignite-Net-2.1/), and a long time since the last major Ignite release. In this post I would like to catch up on all the improvements on .NET side of things.

# Thin Client and Partition Awareness




TODO:
- Recap of changes since 2.1
- Explain Thin Client briefly

- Explain cross-platform support along with .NET Core 3.x support (Linux, macOS, Mono), no more C++ layer and extra DLLs, no more powershell scrips, publish works, still supports .NET 4.0
